## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a solution to the Gym Traning. The Gym challenge help us to improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.Once you have completed the course above, go through these exercises
For each of these projects, create a GitHub repo for them and use react(in the create react app form).
In this exercise, we will use reactjs, tailwind and css
These exercises will help you apply the basic concepts of React through tiny projects. Once you finish all exercises, you'll know you've got the basics down. Then you can start learning more advanced concepts, and build more complicated projects
